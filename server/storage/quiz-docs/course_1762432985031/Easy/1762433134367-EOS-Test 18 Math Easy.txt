Q.7) Algebra, Linear equations in one variable
A laboratory researcher recorded the accumulation of sediment in a tank over 6 days. The total accumulation was initially measured to be 72 grams. After recalculating for measurement errors, the researcher found that the actual accumulation was 18 grams less. What was the corrected amount of sediment accumulation, in grams, per day?
A) 3
B) 9
C) 12
D) 15
Answer: B
Explanation:
The initial measurement was 72 grams, but after accounting for an 18-gram measurement error, the corrected total accumulation is 72-18-54 grams. The observation lasted for 6 days.
The corrected amount of sediment accumulation per day can be found by dividing the corrected total by 6 . Therefore, the corrected amount, in grams, per day is 54/6-9.
Choice A is incorrect, and may have resulted from incorrectly dividing the decrease in the sediment by the number of days.
Choice C is incorrect, and may have resulted from incorrectly dividing the initial sediment measured by the number of days without accounting for the error. Choice D is incorrect, and may have resulted from incorrectly dividing the sum of the initial measured sediment and the decrease by the number of days.

In a conservation project, the final bird count C_f, after a year was determined by the formula C_f-Rm+150, where R is the average monthly increase in the number of birds, m is the number of months, and 150 is the initial bird count. Which equation gives the average monthly increase in terms of the final count and the number of months?
A) R-(C_f+150)/m
B) R-150/(C_f-m)
C) R-C_f m-150
D) R-(C_f-150)/m
Answer: D
Explanation:
Given: C_f-Rm+150
Subtracting 150 from both sides yields C_f-150-Rm
Or, Rm-C_f-150
Dividing both sides by m yields R-(C_f-150)/m
Choice A is incorrect: it inaccurately adds 150 instead of subtracting it from the final count before dividing by m.
Choice B is incorrect: it improperly calculates R by dividing the initial count by the difference between the final count and the number of months, which doesn't align with the formula's structure.
Choice C is incorrect: it suggests a multiplication that does not fit the relationship described by the given formula.

Q.19) Algebra, Linear inequalities in one or two variables
A factory produces 360 to 450 widgets in 10 days. At this rate, which inequality represents the number of widgets, w, produced over a period of 12 days?
A) 432=w=540
B) 36=w=45
C) 300=w=375
D) 362=w=452
Answer: A
Explanation:
The number of widgets produced in 10 days is 360 to 450 .
Therefore, the number of widgets produced in 1 day is 36 to 45 .
Therefore, the number of widgets produced in 12 days is 36×12=432 to 45×12=540.
So we have 432=w=540.
Choice B is incorrect: it represents the number of widgets produced in 1 day, not 12 days.
Choice C is incorrect, and may have resulted from multiplying 360 and 450 by 5/6 instead of 6/5 while trying to convert the figures from 10 days to 12 days directly.
Choice D is incorrect: it adds the difference between 12 and 10 to the numbers produced in 10 days.

Q.20) Algebra, Linear equations in two variables
A company tracks the fuel expenses for its fleet, which includes electric cars and diesel trucks. The fleet comprises 45 electric cars and 80 diesel trucks. The total fuel cost per month for these vehicles is $9,800. The equation 45c+80t=9,800 represents this situation. Which of the following is the best interpretation of t in this context?
A) The average fuel cost per month, in dollars, for each electric car
B) The total fuel cost per month, in dollars, for the electric cars
C) The average fuel cost per month, in dollars, for each diesel truck
D) The total fuel cost per month, in dollars, for the diesel trucks
Answer: C
Explanation:
In the equation 45c+80t=9,800, the right-hand side represents the total cost per month in dollars. Therefore, each term on the left-hand side must also represent a dollar amount.
As the term 80t represents a dollar amount, where 80 represents the number of diesel trucks, the unit of t must be dollars per diesel truck. This is the average fuel cost per month for each diesel truck.
Choice A is incorrect: the average fuel cost per month, in dollars, for each electric car is denoted by c, not t.
Choice B is incorrect: the total fuel cost per month, in dollars, for the electric cars is denoted by 45c, not t.
Choice D is incorrect: the total fuel cost per month for the diesel trucks is denoted by 80t, not t.

Q.21) Algebra, Linear functions
YearProduction (gallons)20153502020250The table above shows the annual production of a small honey farm in gallons, for the years 2015 and 2020. If the relationship between production and year is linear, which of the following functions H models the honey production, in gallons, t years after 2015?
A) H(t)=350-20(t-2015)
B) H(t)=350-20t
C) H(t)=350-20(2015-t)
D) H(t)=350+20t
  Answer: B
Explanation:
As the function H is linear, it can be represented as H(t)=mt+b, where m is the slope and b is the initial production when t=0 (year 2015). Thus, b=350 gallons.
To find the slope m, we use the change in production from 2015 to 2020 as:
m=(H(5)-H(0))/(2020-2015)=(250-350)/5=-20.
This gives the function H(t)=-20t+350, or H(t)=350-20t
Choice A is incorrect, and may have resulted from misunderstanding the correct base year adjustment.
Choice C is incorrect, and may have resulted from misunderstanding the correct base year adjustment as well as its sign.
Choice D is incorrect: it shows a function with a slope of 20 instead of -20 .

A) 2
B) 2.5
C) 4
D) 7.5
Answer: D
Explanation:
As ¯AB is parallel to ¯QP.?ABO is congruent to ?OQP (alternate interior angles), ?BAO is congruent to ?QPO (alternate interior angles), and ?AOB is congruent to ?POQ (vertical angles).
Therefore, triangle ABO is similar to triangle PQO. Therefore, AO/PO=BO/QO
¦(& ?(2p+6)/(p+3)=5/QO@& ?(2(p+3))/(p+3)=5/QO@& ?2=5/QO)
Therefore, QO=OQ=5/2=2.5
BQ=BO+OQ=5+2.5=7.5
Choice A is incorrect: it is the scale factor between the two similar triangles, not the length of ¯BQ.
Choice B is incorrect: it is the length of ¯OQ., not the length of ¯BQ.
Choice C is incorrect, and may have resulted from conceptual or calculation errors.
